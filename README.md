This was a high school programming project, where I tried to make a Binding of Isaac/Enter the Gungeon clone.
There's a ton of potential in the code in this repository, because I started by making the code extensible and general.
Unfortunately, I ran out of time and so the product that you see now is almost nothing like what I intended.

It's worth checking out the code, though, because I think I had some cool ideas with the classes here (particularly the GameMember class.)

To run the code, you'll need the natives for Slick2D installed on your system, which is a LWJGL wrapper library designed to
make writing games in Java easier. I've never been able to get this code working on anything other than the Mac I wrote it on,
unfortunately.
